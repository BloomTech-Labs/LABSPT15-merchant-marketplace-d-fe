# Development Description

## What We Did

During our labs project, we completed the following:

- As a user, I can login using Okta auth
- As a seller, I can see my inventory
- As a seller, I can add items to my inventory and allow them to be on sale or not (hide the product from the buyer)
- As a seller, I would like to see and edit my seller profile
- As seller, I would like to add pictures to items that way the shopper will love the item at first sight
- As a seller, I can edit existing products in my inventory
- As a shopper, I want to be able to save/favorite items

## ToDo's

Our recommendations on things to start on:

- Take some time to familiarize yourself with the codebase
- Styling the EditProfileForm and the seller dashboard
- Styling and adding validation to the EditItemForm
- Adding routing that sends sellers to the seller dashboard and shoppers to a shopper dashboard or landing page on login
- Complete the remaining project requirements

## New Packages

- We included two new npm packages: 'google-maps-react' and 'react-google-autocomplete'
